This are my thoughts on how to implement prediction and correction:

Questions:
Should I predict only the player object or every enemy also?
- Start with only player

Do I need velocity sent from server to client?
- No, the only thing I need from server is information to know if my prediction was correct or not. Meaning position and rotation.
^^ is wrong, I need to velocity when re-predicting the client movement as this number also might missmatch.

Is the server and client ticks the same or do I need to align these?
- ??

Package drops on the input message?
No idea... I assume server would have to assume it get's the same input as last time it recived a valid input. Or assume no input?
Not part of the scope for this, but explore how this is done in other games!
Seems to be a paragraph around that in this article:

Correction, why I can't just replace the new information from server on the client. 
- The client already moved on and are further away in the future. Meaning I need to store historical data on the client, so that I can use this to re-predict whenever I get a corrected state. This page explains this pretty well:

Approach
- Predict player rotation and position on client
- Add tick number to both input and state package (make sure these are aligned)
	- Update tick on client on every package from server?
- Add storage of historical tick data on client (for resimulation)
- When new state package, check if position and rotation matches (on that particular tick?)
	- If true, all good!
	- If false, correct that ticks information and re-run the prediction from that point to present the new real (future) position


Limiations
- Only predict and correct local player, not all other players.
